# Contributing Guidelines

Thanks for your interest in **ConquestConsole**.

This project exists to **research, reverse-engineer, and experiment with
LOTR: Conquest (2009)** at a low level.  
It is not a modpack, not a finished product, and not a beginner tutorial.

Think of it as a **research playground**.

---
- Curiosity over polish
- Evidence over assumptions
- Baby steps over big claims
- Sharing over gatekeeping

Messy scripts, throwaway tools, brute-force experiments, and partial findings
are expected. They are part of the process.

---
This Project focuses on:

- Reverse engineering of **LOTR: Conquest (Zero Engine)**
- Runtime debugging, memory patching, and tooling
- In-game console and developer utilities
- Research and documentation, not redistribution

This repository **does not ship**:
- Game executables
- Modified binaries
- Copyrighted assets

If something looks overly specific to one game then yes **that is intentional**.

---
Before opening a Pull Request:

- Open an **Issue** or start a discussion first
- Clearly explain *what* you want to change and *why*
- Make sure it aligns with the project’s goals

Unsolicited large refactors or engine behavior changes
without discussion may be rejected.

This is a small, research-driven project.
Expect careful review and slow responses.

---
- Primary language: **C++ (Win32)**  
- Supporting work: **x86 assembly**
- Keep changes minimal and focused
- Avoid hard-coded offsets where possible
- Prefer pattern scanning and documented behavior
- Comment reverse-engineered logic clearly
---
Research contributions are especially welcome, including:

- Engine behavior analysis
- Timing / threading observations
- Audio or Wwise-related findings
- Tooling experiments
- Documentation improvements

When possible, include:
- Ghidra/IDA notes
- Call stacks
- Disassembly snippets
- Logs or reproducible steps

Clarity matters more than presentation.

---
Please do **not** submit:

- Game executables or modified binaries
- Copyrighted assets
- Decompiled or reconstructed proprietary source code
- Cheats or exploits intended for online abuse
- "Trust me bro" claims without data

If you disagree with something, explain why.
If you improve something, show how.

---
- No drama
- No ego contests
- No gatekeeping

Disagreement is fine.
Evidence is required.

---
This repository is maintained by a very small number of people,
sometimes just one.

Expect rough edges.
Expect unfinished tools.
Expect ongoing experiments.

If you’re here to learn, test, analyze, or help then welcome.
